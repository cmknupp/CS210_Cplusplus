# CS210_Cplusplus
Project Three

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving:
Grocery Tracking program built to  accept a text file containing items purchased.  Data then seperated into a list of items and quanties sold.  Menu loop gave user a choice of printing all items/quantities sold as a numberic value, look up the frequency of one specific item or view a histogram of all items/frequencies.  Created to meet specifications which included what functions should be completed in C++ and which should be done in Python.  This allowed user to better organize store based off of frequency of items being sold. 

What did you do particularly well?
I followed specifications and had all functions working correctly.  I attempted to write clean code that did not contain redundancy.  Output was well formatted and easy to interpret.  

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I am not sure we've learned much about keeping code secure yet.  I made it able to handle exceptions that my occur but would like to learn more on how to increase security of code. I also would like to better understand the "wrappers" for calling the Python functions that were provided. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? I originally thought to pass the input file name as the string parameter to Python and ran into issues when I had to pass the item name to Python. I was thinking the users may want to interpret many files as frequency of items purchased would likely change based on season/holidays and such. I was unsure how to pass two parameters and started to write code to combine the file name and item name in a string with a seperator that Python could then parse out.  I then realized I was making it too complicated.  I added the input File name to Python and then just passed the item name. 

What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?  
I recently added github to my tools/support network.  As I learn more in the field I have been finding instruction videos on you-tube that better explain some of the thought processes behind writing efficient code. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Being able to integrate multiple languages and work with their benefits and around their challenges is a great skill to help with future projects.  

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I attempted to seperate any code I needed to do more than once into a seperate function to make it maintainable and adaptable.  For readability I really increased my use of comments.  I realized the value of comments during this course.  I wrote minimal comments in prior courses, I think commenting becomes more important as the complexity of projects increases.
